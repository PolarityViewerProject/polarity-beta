[Viewer/Build]
- changed : compiler options for "Release with Debug" builds
- changed : compiler and linker options for "Release" builds
- changed : removed LL's changeset tags and added new (consistent) SL-X.Y.Z tags for releases
- changed : break into the debugger rather than forcing the process into an unrecoverable state for "llerrs" on non-release builds
    -> Windows only
- changed : set the "UNATTENDED" flag to FALSE for all (Windows) *OS build configurations
- fixed   : viewer fails to compile with only the Windows 8 SDK installed
